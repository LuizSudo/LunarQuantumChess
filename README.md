# Lunar Quantum Chess

**Lunar Quantum Chess** is a minimalist and experimental implementation of **Quantum Chess**, developed using **Lua** and the **LÖVE 2D** framework. The project explores how core principles of quantum mechanics — such as superposition and entanglement — can be represented and simulated in a turn-based board game environment.

This implementation is intended for educational and learning purposes, with a focus on experimentation rather than competitive gameplay.

## Overview

Quantum Chess modifies classical chess by incorporating mechanics inspired by quantum physics. In Lunar Quantum Chess, pieces can exist in multiple positions simultaneously, become entangled with one another, and collapse into definite states when observed.

This project is a simplified and accessible version of these ideas, implemented in a lightweight codebase designed for learning and modification.
